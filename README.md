# Syphon-AutoClicker-V2

**this is my first C++ project.**

**this autoclicker can go up to 5000 clicks per second.**
**it doesn't support custom hotkeys but i might add them in the future.**

**the hotkeys are:**
**Mouse Button 5 to toggle the autoclicking.**
**Delete to minimize/maximize.**
**Home to change the clicks per second.**
**Pause to terminate the script.**

**the reason i made this is because i wanted to specify how many clicks per second i want and not just the delay like some other autoclickers.**
